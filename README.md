# Longest Common Subsequence

This is a Python 3 implementation of the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. The LCS algorithm is a classic string algorithm which finds the longest common subsequence between two strings. It can be used for a variety of applications from Natural Language Processing to Bioinformatics.

# How to use

To use this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the main.py script. You can change the strings to search for the length of the longest common subsequence with the following command:

`python main.py -s1 string1 -s2 string2`
